**DAY 1 SPRINT**

My aim today is to
- set up Trello
- set up Github repo
- complete copy writing
- complete selection of colour theme
- design wireframes
- take screenshots of progress 
- minimise image sizes of screenshots
- add screenshots into README
- if time, bring forward some of tomorrow's tasks e.g. spike.

**Project management**

*Github*

I set up Github this morning and started adding planning notes into the README file. 

I've also created an Images folder to store images in.

*Trello*

I set up Trello with days organised as sprints with daily retrospectives up until Friday. I've allocated tasks to each day and labelled each rubric criteria with the days that its areas are being worked on (see screenshot 1).

**Portfolio requirements**

Notes from Leah when going through rubric: 
- try a spike (e.g. 2 hours) early on to consider whether technically the design is appropriate given the timeframe and assessment parameters
- RE images: minimise image sizes, try 1MB or lower if poss. 
- By tomorrow lunch, get approval on design
- To try multiple browsers, go to diff. browser e.g. Firefox, clear cache and load it in to check loading time / how fonts work etc. 
- RE font, 'less is more', e.g. one heading font / one other font or all same font with diff. weights
- Could try Hemgingway site
- RE tables, use tables in readme (Leah to clarify)
  
**Draft copy**

Hi! I'm a curriculum developer in Melbourne, Australia. After 10+ years working in education, I'm training to be a web developerâ€”my dream job! 

I do other stuff too, like
- wite copy
- write content

Good design and art lights me up, as does my Devon Rex cat, Admiral Nelson. 

I want to leave the world a better place than when I came into it.
