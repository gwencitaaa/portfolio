Web portfolio for Coder Academy bootcamp assessment

**DAY 1 SPRINT**

My aim today is to
- set up Trello
- set up Github repo
- complete copy writing
- complete selection of colour theme
- design wireframes
- take screenshots of progress 
- minimise image sizes of screenshots
- add screenshots into README
- if time, bring forward some of tomorrow's tasks e.g. spike.

**Project management**

*Github*

I set up Github this morning and started adding planning notes into the README file. I've also created an Images folder to store images in.

*Figma*
I created some colour pallettes last night from a Klimt painting that I love (see screenshot below). The feeling of dark colours with bright highlights was what I felt like playing with intuitively for my portfolio.

When I thought about it, it was the colours from a photo of a big city after rain at night, with neon lights and blurred streelights that I was trying to get. I remembered a wall decorated for a Wed Anderson movie where there was a night scene with lights where the city buildings were like paper cut outs. I loved it so much, so I tracked down a picture of that and found a couple others for inspiration. I added these into Trello so I could refer back to them. 


*Trello*

I set up Trello with days organised as sprints with daily retrospectives up until Friday (see screenshot 1. I've allocated tasks to each day and labelled each rubric criteria with the days that its areas are being worked on. Screenshot 2 shows Day 1 (Tuesday's) tasks.

**Portfolio requirements**

Notes from Leah when going through rubric: 
- try a spike (e.g. 2 hours) early on to consider whether technically the design is appropriate given the timeframe and assessment parameters
- RE images: minimise image sizes, try 1MB or lower if poss. 
- By tomorrow lunch, get approval on design
- To try multiple browsers, go to diff. browser e.g. Firefox, clear cache and load it in to check loading time / how fonts work etc. 
- RE font, 'less is more', e.g. one heading font / one other font or all same font with diff. weights
- Could try Hemgingway site
- RE tables, use tables in readme (Leah to clarify)
